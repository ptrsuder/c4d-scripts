Some python scripts for Cinema 4D (tested on 2025)

* Mirror Joint Hierarchy - adds mirror constraints to one side (right) of the selected joints 
* Point based weight tag transfer - copies weights from one mesh to another using closest points. Modified to work on modern version, credits for original author inside
* SelectionToObject - splits object into multiple based on material selections. Converted/modified from plugin with same name, credits inside
* Set Axis - sets object axis PSR (same result as with Axis modification tool

* CopyPose - XGroup to use with XPresso tag. Copies PSR from bones in one joint hierarchy to other. Works by matching names (children joints can be in different order)
